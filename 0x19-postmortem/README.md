**Issue Summary:**

**Duration of the Outage:**  
Start Time: 2024-08-15, 10:00 AM (UTC)  
End Time: 2024-08-15, 12:45 PM (UTC)  
Total Duration: 2 hours 45 minutes

**Impact:**  
During the outage, our e-commerce platform experienced severe slowdowns, affecting checkout processes. Approximately 65% of users were unable to complete transactions, leading to a significant dip in sales during the affected period. Users reported prolonged loading times and occasional timeout errors when attempting to make purchases. 

**Root Cause:**  
A database query related to the product search feature was inadvertently modified during a recent deployment, leading to a significant increase in load times and eventually causing a cascading failure in our database servers.

**Timeline:**

- **10:00 AM** - Issue detected by automated monitoring system, which flagged an unusual spike in database response times.
- **10:05 AM** - On-call engineer notified by the monitoring alert and immediately started investigating the database performance metrics.
- **10:15 AM** - Initial assumption: the issue was related to an increased number of concurrent users due to an ongoing promotional event.
- **10:25 AM** - Misleading path: The engineering team scaled the application servers, suspecting a load balancing issue, but this did not resolve the problem.
- **10:45 AM** - Database performance was further analyzed; slow query logs were identified but not yet linked to the root cause.
- **11:00 AM** - Issue escalated to the database team after application-level adjustments proved ineffective.
- **11:15 AM** - Database team identified a recent change in the product search query logic, which had caused the increased load.
- **11:30 AM** - Hotfix deployed to revert the problematic query to its previous state.
- **12:00 PM** - Database performance stabilized, and the platform began returning to normal operation.
- **12:45 PM** - Final checks confirmed that all systems were operating within normal parameters, and the incident was declared resolved.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

The root cause of the outage was a modification to the product search query logic deployed in a recent update. The new query was not optimized for the volume of data in the product database, leading to excessive CPU usage on the database servers. This, in turn, caused significant delays in processing requests, ultimately resulting in timeouts and a degraded user experience.

The issue was resolved by identifying the problematic query through slow query logs and reverting it to its previous, optimized version. A hotfix was deployed, and the database performance returned to normal shortly afterward.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

**Improvements:**  
1. **Review Deployment Process:** Implement a more stringent code review and testing process, especially for changes affecting critical systems like the database.
2. **Monitoring Enhancements:** Add more detailed monitoring for database query performance, including alerts specifically for slow queries.
3. **Load Testing:** Increase the frequency of load testing in pre-production environments to identify potential performance issues before deployment.

**Task List:**
- **Code Review:** Establish mandatory peer review for any changes involving database queries.
- **Monitoring:** Set up new alerts for queries that exceed a specific response time threshold.
- **Load Testing:** Integrate automated load testing into the CI/CD pipeline to catch performance regressions earlier.
- **Documentation:** Update the incident response documentation to include recent learnings from this outage.

By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure a more resilient and reliable platform for our users.
